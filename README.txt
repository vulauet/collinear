Topics: Sorting Algorithms
===========================================

This is my implementation for the 3rd Assignment of Coursera's Algorithms, Part 1 course by Stanford University.
Read the Writeup for the assignment's specification and additional installation.
Note: I only implemented Point.java, BruteCollinearPoints.java and FastCollinearPoints.java, the rest were provided by the course's staff.
